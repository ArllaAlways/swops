## Concept Overview

SWOPS matches renters for short, reciprocal home swaps (e.g., Fitzroy ↔ St Kilda, Sydney ↔ Melbourne). No cash changes hands between users. SWOPS charges a flat $100/person matching fee per confirmed swap.

The platform is framed as **mutual hospitality** — not subletting, not commercial short-stay accommodation.

## Legal Position: Subletting vs. Guest Stays

### The Core Argument

SWOPS isn't subletting — it's reciprocal hosting. The distinction matters legally:

| | Subletting | Guest Stay |
|---|---|---|
| Exclusive possession granted? | Yes | No |
| Commercial transaction? | Typically yes | No |
| Requires landlord consent? | Yes (VIC & NSW) | Generally no |
| Lease breach risk? | High | Low–moderate |

### VIC (Residential Tenancies Act 1997)
- Subletting requires landlord consent and grants the sub-renter exclusive possession
- Short-term guest stays are generally permissible without consent if non-commercial and brief (commonly 7–14 days depending on lease terms)

### NSW (Residential Tenancies Act 2010)
- Same framework applies — consent required for sublets, guests generally fine without it

### The Grey Area
The absence of a tenant during a swap could imply exclusive possession has been ceded, even without a formal subletting arrangement. The no-cash element helps, but isn't conclusive.

**Suggested framing:** "Many standard leases permit short-term guests" (not "most" — avoids overstatement).

## Exclusive Possession — The Key Test

### Definition
The legal right to sole use and control of a premises, to the exclusion of all others — including the landlord and the tenant themselves.

### Key Precedents
- **Radaich v Smith [1959] HCA 45** — foundational Australian case establishing the substance-over-form test
- **Street v Mountford [1985] UKHL 4** — exclusive possession as the hallmark of a tenancy
- **Swan v Uecker [2016] VSC 313** — Victorian Supreme Court ruling that Airbnb short stays constituted sub-leases

### Applied to SWOPS
Courts look at **substance, not labels**. Factors that increase risk:
- Tenant is entirely absent during the swap
- Guest has full key access with no landlord or tenant present
- No genuine mechanism for tenant to return or revoke

Factors that reduce risk:
- Reciprocal nature (both parties are simultaneously guests)
- No payment between users
- Short duration
- Tenant retains set of keys and right to return

## Differences from Airbnb

SWOPS is materially different from Airbnb in ways that weaken the subletting argument:

| | Airbnb | SWOPS |
|---|---|---|
| Payment between users | Yes — host earns income | No — fee to platform only |
| Commercial intent | Clear | Absent |
| Reciprocity | None | Core to the model |
| Public listing | Yes | No — private matching |
| Head-tenant/sub-tenant hierarchy? | Yes | No — both parties are peers |

### Why Swan v Uecker Doesn't Directly Apply

*Swan v Uecker* (and most Airbnb-related rulings) turned on two factors: **payment for accommodation** and a **one-way power dynamic** where one party profited by granting the other exclusive use. This mirrors a standard tenancy — which is exactly why courts treated it as one.

SWOPS inverts that structure. Both parties are renters, both are simultaneously guests in each other's homes, and neither profits. There's no head-tenant extracting value from a sub-tenant. Subletting law is designed to prevent commercial exploitation of leased premises — SWOPS doesn't do that.

### The Slippery Slope Argument — Addressed

A reasonable concern: *if renters have the right to swap homes, doesn't that logically support their right to sublet for cash while away?*

The answer is no — and the law already draws this line clearly:

- **Non-commercial mutual exchange** sits within the same legal territory as having a housesitter or long-term guest — arrangements that are broadly accepted
- **Cash subletting** creates a financial relationship, a separate tenancy, and a profit motive — the things tenancy law specifically regulates
- Value extracted through **equity** (both parties save on holiday costs) is fundamentally different from value extracted through **cash flow** (one party profits at the property's expense)
- Recent tenancy reforms (2025–2026) focus on protecting renters from landlords, not restricting how renters use their homes for non-commercial purposes

No reported case law connects non-cash home swaps to broader sublet rights claims. The legal distinction exists, holds, and is worth fighting for.

### HomeExchange as Comparable Precedent

HomeExchange (200,000+ members globally, operating in Australia) explicitly advises renters they can participate — framing swaps as non-subletting due to the absence of payment. They recommend checking individual leases, but there are **no reported legal cases against renters using the platform in Australia**. SWOPS's renter-only, intra-city model is arguably more defensible — less tourism-driven, more community-based.

> No swap-specific case law exists in Australia as of February 2026. This is genuinely novel territory — not inherently doomed, and potentially worth establishing.

## Swop Agreement Clauses

Recommended clauses in the SWOPS user agreement to support a licence (not tenancy) characterisation:

1. **Tenant retains keys** — physical demonstration of retained possession
2. **Right to return** — tenant can re-enter the property at any time
3. **No exclusive possession granted** — explicit denial in writing
4. **Revocability** — either party can cancel the swap at any time
5. **Short fixed durations** — maximum swap length defined (e.g., 5 nights)

### Limitations
Substance over form applies — if these clauses aren't genuine and exercisable in practice, courts may disregard them (per *Swan*). The clauses need to reflect real arrangements, not just paper protections.

---

## Revocability Clause Analysis

A revocability clause signals a **licence** (permission that can be withdrawn) rather than a lease (a fixed interest in land).

**Helps because:**
- Indicates no fixed term was granted
- Consistent with a guest arrangement

**Limits:**
- If never exercised in practice, courts treat it as a sham
- Erodes user trust if invoked frequently

**Make it genuine:** Build revocation tools into the platform (cancellation flow, notifications). Log revocations if they occur.

---

## Guest Stays While Tenant is Away

A tenant having a friend stay for 2 nights while they're at their parents' place is **normal guest behaviour** — not a breach of quiet enjoyment obligations or lease terms under VIC or NSW law, provided:

- The stay is short and non-commercial
- The lease has no explicit prohibition
- The guest isn't paying the tenant

SWOPS swaps in this framing are closer to "I asked a friend to housesit" than "I listed my apartment on Airbnb." The reciprocal nature reinforces this.

## Key Risks & Recommendations

### Risks
- **Exclusive possession finding** — if courts treat swaps as sublets, users face potential lease termination
- **Damage liability** — tenants remain liable for damage caused by swap guests
- **Misleading claims** — overstating legal safety could expose SWOPS to liability
- **Inconsistent lease terms** — some leases prohibit any third-party access; no universal rule applies

### Recommendations

**For SWOPS as a platform:**
- Always advise users to check their individual lease and seek landlord consent where uncertain
- Include clear disclaimers: *"SWOPS provides general information only. We are not lawyers. Check your lease."*
- Explore partnerships with Tenants Victoria / Tenants NSW for credibility and reach
- Monitor ongoing tenancy law reforms — no-fault eviction bans (2025–2026) signal a tenant-friendly shift that may normalise flexibility

**For users:**
- Check your lease for guest duration limits and subletting clauses
- If in doubt, ask your landlord — framing it as "a friend is staying while I'm away" is often fine
- Keep swaps short (2–4 nights) to stay firmly within guest territory
- Don't hand over keys without retaining a set yourself

### Overall Position
SWOPS occupies a **genuine legal grey area** — closer to reciprocal guest stays than subletting, but without definitive case law to rely on. The non-commercial, reciprocal structure is the strongest defence. Short durations and retained possession rights are critical supporting factors.

The absence of case law cuts both ways, but the better read is this: Airbnb was challenged because it was transparently commercial. SWOPS isn't. The legal risk is real but navigable — and launching small, gathering outcomes, and building renter-advocacy relationships could help establish positive precedent in a reform-friendly environment.
