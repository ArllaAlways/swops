# SWOPS STRATEGY BRIEF
Read this before any strategic, copy, or business discussion about SWOPS.

## What SWOPS Is
Peer-to-peer home swapping platform for Australian renters. SWOPS privately matches renters with renters to swap homes for short breaks. No public listings. No landlords. No agents. Just a change of scene without paying for accommodation.

The core insight: renters already pay for a home. When they travel, they pay again for somewhere to stay. SWOPS unlocks the dormant value of their existing rent.

## Local Swaps First
SWOPS will eventually offer interstate swaps (Melbourne↔Sydney and beyond), but to build liquidity, trust, and network density we are launching with hyperlocal intra-city swaps as the foundation.

**Examples:**
- Brunswick ↔ St Kilda
- Fitzroy ↔ Torquay
- Newtown ↔ Manly

**Why local first:**
- Eliminates the interstate liquidity problem — no longer need two people travelling in opposite directions simultaneously
- Lower risk for first-time users — no flights, just a short drive
- If something goes wrong you're 45 minutes away, not interstate
- Builds trust and density locally before opening higher-stakes interstate swaps
- Proximity may reduce perceived legal risk around exclusive possession
- Sharehouses can participate — three housemates swapping with another sharehouse costs ~$33 each

**Staged rollout:**
1. Local swaps within Melbourne and within Sydney
2. Once trust and density established, open to Sydney↔Melbourne interstate
3. Broader city and national expansion

## Value Proposition
**"$100 Holidays"**

A swop costs $100 per person. That's it. With local swaps, this is literally the entire cost of the weekend — no flights, just a short drive and food you'd buy anyway.

No booking fees. No cleaning fees. Just a flat hundred so you can save thousands.

This framing is most accurate and powerful with local swaps where flights are removed from the equation entirely.

## Target Market
**Primary (early adopters):** Creative industry renters. Renters in inner-city Melbourne suburbs (Brunswick, Fitzroy, Thornbury, Collingwood, St Kilda) and Sydney equivalents (Newtown, Surry Hills, Glebe, Marrickville). Ages 25–40. Comfortable with mild weirdness. Frustrated by rent and cost of living. Cultural pioneers.

**Secondary (mainstream follow):** Broader renter market once the concept has been validated and normalised by early adopters. The "gentrification model" — normies follow once artists have made something cool.

**Sharehouse market:** Groups of housemates can swap together, dramatically lowering per-person cost and reducing the psychological barrier of strangers in your space.

---

## Brand Voice
Cheeky, confident, slightly punk. Nico's Deli energy. Dry humour, plain language, no startup fluff. Copy is the personality — not interface gimmicks.

Speaks directly to frustrated renters. Acknowledges the housing crisis reality while maintaining optimism. Anti-establishment without being aggressive. Between renters, for renters.

**Never say:** "innovative," "seamless," "community-driven," "disrupting," or any aspirational startup language.

**Always say:** what you mean, plainly, with a slight edge.

---

## How It Works
1. Register interest for a swop window
2. Get matched
3. Meet your swopmate/s on a video call, see the place
4. Swop — or don't. Up to you.

The video call step is non-negotiable. It's the trust mechanism. No reviews, no star ratings — you make your own judgement about whether it feels right.

---

## Legal Position
SWOPS frames exchanges as **reciprocal guest stays** rather than subleases. The simultaneous, reciprocal nature prevents the abuse scenarios associated with traditional subleasing. Both parties have skin in the game.

Users are advised to double-check their lease on short-term guest rules before registering. SWOPS does not encourage lease violations — it operates in the grey area of mutual hospitality that most leases don't explicitly address.

No cash changes hands for accommodation. The $100 fee is a platform/matching fee, not rent.

---

## Business Model
- **Fee:** $100 per person per swop
- **Revenue per swop:** $200 (both parties pay)
- **No other fees:** No booking fee, no cleaning fee, no service fee

**Revenue targets:**
- 20 swops/week = ~$208k/year gross
- 58 swops/week = ~$600k/year gross (supports ~$400k personal income after lean costs)
- 3,000 swops/year = $600k gross

**Pricing notes:** $100 is the launch price. As the network matures and trust is established, pricing can increase. Even at $150/person ($300/swop), 2,000 swops/year hits $600k. Price increases are easier to justify as the platform proves its value.

---

## Drop Model
The drop model is a cold-start technique, not a permanent feature. Concentrating demand around specific weekends makes matching viable at low network density. The long-term vision is always-on availability — register your available dates and receive matches as they come.

---

## Competitive Landscape
No direct competitor exists for hyperlocal renter-to-renter micro-swaps.

Adjacent platforms:
- **HomeExchange / LoveHomeSwap** — international travel focus, longer stays, different demographic, earnest tone
- **Couchsurfing** — free but not reciprocal, different trust dynamic
- **Airbnb** — commercial, host/guest not peer swap, no incentive to build this
- **Facebook groups** — informal, unstructured, no matching infrastructure

The gap exists because the trust and matching problems are hard, not because the idea is wrong.

---

## Key Risks
- **Trust barrier:** Strangers in your home is a psychological hurdle. Mitigated by video call requirement, local swaps, and mutual skin-in-the-game.
- **Matching density:** Early on, registered users may outnumber actual swops. Drop model helps concentrate demand.
- **Lease risk:** Some renters may be in violation of their lease. SWOPS is transparent about this risk and advises users to check their lease.
- **Founder bandwidth:** Being built alongside Hooves (production company). Early stage is manageable. Scaling requires either AI automation or hiring.
